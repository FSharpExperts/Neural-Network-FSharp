# A second Neural Network in F# 
A basic implementation of a Neural Network and trainer for Xor and [MNIST digit recognition](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)  in F#.

This project was created as an exercise for the Machine Learning season at the [Cambridge Programmer's Study Group](http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Programmers-Study-Group/).  
The [orignal version](https://github.com/it-depends/CPSG-ML/tree/master/meetups/03-NeuralNetwork) was in F#.  I then re-did it 
in [C#](https://github.com/it-depends/Neural-Network-CSharp) because I 
wanted see how different the implementation was with a 'traditional' OO approach.  However it was hard to compare the versions
as the F# code contained a lot of wrong turns and cruft from the trial and error of learning, it was also 'pure' functional 
as an exercise.  So here's another F# version that is structually derived from C# version but with a functional style.
